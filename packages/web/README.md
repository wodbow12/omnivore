First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://192.168.10.182:3000](http://192.168.10.182:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

Create a new file in this same dir and name it `env.local`. Copy the contents of `.env.template` and paste it in. Fill in your own values for the services you need and the urls you will be deploying to.
